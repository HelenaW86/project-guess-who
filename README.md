Guess who

This project was about building a guess who game with different caracters who is sorting out by their differences. The point is to find the secret one.

I had to practice arrays and objects and how to pick upp values from each of them. 
How to filter the caracters was a littel bit tricky, but with a keep param, a generate board function and some if and else statement it finaly worked.
